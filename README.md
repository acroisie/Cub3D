# Cub3D

Here is the Cub3D project wroted by [Luthernmr](https://github.com/Luthernmr) and I.

The goal of this project is to achieve a basic Raycaster in C.

The rules:

* Parse the map and manage all error cases
* Render the 3D without distortion
* Like all C project from 42 you have to follow the 42 norm and leaks are not allowed.

You want to play with it? Start a beautifull shell (inception) and type > Make && ./Cube3D "map_name"
